p. Brings a simple and minimal Quicktags Textile inserting bar to the backend. No, it's not an heavy and buggy WYSIWYG editor that screws your own XHTML input, but instead it's just a simple bar that insert Textile where you want. The Javascript code is forked from "hak_textile_tags by great hakjoon.":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=7470
